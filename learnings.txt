When something is added using 
git add  <filename>
git commit -m "<commit message>"  ---> to add changes to local repo
it comes in staging area
git diff       --->it shows what changes are modified
git status  --> to  check status
git log   -->to see history or commits

To see what is present in previous version we need it's id which we can get it in git log then
git show <id>:<path of file to see>
i.e git show fe54d0e0ddb20e38d9e42:index.html
it only works for single file and not good for big applications
Inorder to reflex previous version multiple or single file on current version we can use checkout
 git checkout 
fe54d0e0ddb20e38d9e4258ac3fb9a352a2ae229 -- *
here * for all file we can specific filename applications
to get back to original version we have to enter
 git checkout master -- *

 In order to get back to previous saved file we can write
 git restore .
 to get back to previously saved point

 if a file is added / staged bymistakenly and want to get back then write 
 git restore --staged .
 and then
 git restore . 

 in order to undo the commit we use reset  
 git reset --hard HEAD^
above cmd is used when we complete remove commit and get back to previous commit
we should hard only when sure about it 
  git reset --soft HEAD

  git log -p -2    (to see diffirences fo 2 changes)
  git log --stat   (to see summary of changes)
  git log --pretty=oneline (to see just oneline changes in each commit)
  git log -S '<tag added>'   -->to see when the tag is added ie in which version

  Till now we are doing changes in local repo
  to make this chaneges to others we need to add it to remote repo, to do that
     
git remote --> to check if linked with remote repository
git remote -v   ->to check to which repository it is linked to 

to bring files from remote repo to local repo pull
git pull  

///branching and merging
git branch   -> shows list of branches
git branch <branch-name>   -> to create a bracnh
git  checkout <branch-name   ->to select that branch
git merge <branch name>  -> to merge to main branch  (make sure u r at main brach first)
